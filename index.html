To collect data and prepare it for analysis, you use channels that listen to devices and pull device messages into AWS IoT Analytics. Once messages are flowing, pipelines process and turn them into useful data using transforms and filters. Pipelines enrich your IoT data with data from other AWS services and external data sources. Processed data is stored in an IoT-optimized data store. Once data is ready to be analyzed, data sets are created by querying the data or using built-in Jupyter Notebook templates for sophisticated analytics like machine learning (ML). AWS IoT Analytics integrates with Amazon SageMaker so you can build ML models. In this session, we deep dive on these components.</td><td>Chalk Talk</td><td><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/building-iot-analytics-iot327r1-aws-reinvent-2018">SlideShare</a></td><td><a>Youtube</a></td></tr><tr><td>STG335</td><td>Kickstart Your All-In Move to the AWS Cloud Using AWS Storage Gateway and Amazon EFS</td><td>When you move your data center to the AWS Cloud, you need an innovative and cost-effective approach to ensure a successful transition.

One of these requirements is that every server in our infrastructure is both ephemeral (&lt;30 days) and immutable. The deployment process for most applications is fairly straightforward: 12-factor apps are blue/green deployed behind a load balancer. Blockchain nodes, however, present a difficult problem: How do you blue/green deploy a server with 1 TB on disk? In this session, we discuss how we solved this problem in a blockchain-agnostic fashion using a new project, called Snapchain.</td><td>Startup Central</td><td><a>SlideShare</a></td><td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPemFSYO0Dw">Youtube</a></td></tr><tr><td>STP15</td><td>How the Cloud Helps Nubank Support Millions of Daily Customers</td><td>Nubank, a Brazilian financial technology company, is empowering customers with a 100% digital banking experience.

Ground stations are at the core of global satellite networks, which are facilities that provide communications between the ground and the satellites by using antenna receivers to receive data and control systems to send radio signals to command and control the satellite. Today, you must either build your own ground stations and antennas, or obtain long-term leases with ground station providers, often in multiple countries to provide enough opportunities to contact the satellites as they orbit the globe. Once all this data is downlinked, you need servers, storage, and networking in close proximity to the antennas to process, store, and transport the data from the satellite. Learn how the new AWS Ground Station eliminates these problems by delivering a ground station-as-a-service, and how this enables you to easily control satellite communications, quickly ingest and process your satellite data, and rapidly integrate that data with your applications and other services running in the AWS Cloud.</td><td>Session</td><td><a>SlideShare</a></td><td><a>Youtube</a></td></tr><tr><td>SEC401</td><td>Mastering Identity at Every Layer of the Cake</td><td>Most workloads on AWS resemble a finely crafted cake, with delight at every layer.
