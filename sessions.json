In this workshop, you enter a scenario in which you help a fictional unicorn ridesharing company, Wild Rydes, (www.wildrydes.com), deploy a critical customer support application using a serverless architecture. When a passenger completes a ride, they can use the app to inform the company if they had any issues with their trip\u2014perhaps a lost wallet or a misbehaving unicorn. Since Wild Rydes is global, this support application takes advantage of a multi-region, highly available architecture using services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Route 53, Amazon CloudFront, and Amazon S3 to maximize availability. It also uses Amazon Cognito federated identities for user authentication. Attendees should bring a laptop and be familiar with the AWS Management Console and the AWS CLI.",

By leveraging the API, developers can implement fully featured Lambda runtimes that support the Lambda programming model. In combination, these two features allow developers to share their runtimes with others as Layers, and allow function developers to seamlessly use them with their functions. In this session, Marco will deep dive into how to use the Layers and Runtime API capabilities to bring your own runtimes and libraries to Lambda.",

We are also seeing some innovative ideas around watermarking tech using blockchain tied to a specific actor within the media workflow to using bitcoin blockchain as a bounty mechanism to protect digital media from online piracy. In this session, we are accompanied by Custos Media, a startup in the M&E space revolutionizing the content distribution business with its novel watermarking and fraud/leak detection mechanism. We discuss the introduction towards blockchain, the applicability of this new tech in some of these M&E use cases, and dispel or discuss the anti-patterns for blockchain in some of these use cases.",

So, getting inference results with very low latency is important to making sure your IoT applications can respond quickly to local events. AWS Greengrass ML Inference gives you the best of both worlds. You use ML models that are built and trained in the cloud and you deploy and run ML inference locally on connected devices. For example, you can build a predictive model in Amazon SageMaker for scene detection analysis and then run it locally on an AWS Greengrass enabled security camera device where there is no cloud connectivity to predict and send an alert when an incoming visitor is detected.

AWS makes it easy for customers to deploy machine learning models in such demanding scenarios. In this session, we review the various patterns that have emerged in this regard. First, we review how Amazon SageMaker enables low latency real-time inferencing. We review the multiple considerations needed to achieve a satisfactory performance. There are some scenarios even in micro-services environments that are suited for batch inferencing. We review how Amazon SageMaker enables large scale batch inferencing. We then review how to make these batch inferences available in low-latency environments by using in-memory stores.

Ground stations are at the core of global satellite networks, which are facilities that provide communications between the ground and the satellites by using antenna receivers to receive data and control systems to send radio signals to command and control the satellite. Today, you must either build your own ground stations and antennas, or obtain long-term leases with ground station providers, often in multiple countries to provide enough opportunities to contact the satellites as they orbit the globe. Once all this data is downlinked, you need servers, storage, and networking in close proximity to the antennas to process, store, and transport the data from the satellite. Learn how the new AWS Ground Station eliminates these problems by delivering a ground station-as-a-service, and how this enables you to easily control satellite communications, quickly ingest and process your satellite data, and rapidly integrate that data with your applications and other services running in the AWS Cloud.",

Labeling raw data to get accurate training datasets involves a lot of time and effort because sophisticated models can require thousands of labeled examples to learn from, before they can produce good results. Typically, the task of labeling is distributed across a large number of humans, adding significant overhead and cost. Join us as we introduce Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth, a new service that provides an effective solution to reduce this cost and complexity using a machine learning technique called active learning. Active learning reduces the time and manual effort required to do data labeling, by continuously training machine learning algorithms based on labels from humans. By iterating through ambiguous data points, Ground Truth improves the ability to automatically label data resulting in high-quality training datasets.",
